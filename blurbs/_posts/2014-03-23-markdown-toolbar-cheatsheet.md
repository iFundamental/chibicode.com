I've created a markdown cheatsheet: [markdown.chibi.io](http://chibicode.github.io/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet).

The main audience is non-technical people. They are used to MS Word, Google Docs, Evernote, Wordpress, etc., all of which have a toolbar like above. By showing a mapping from a toolbar icon to the corresponding markdown syntax, people will be able to learn Markdown faster.

Here's what happens when you click a button:

Minor details: I've included buttons for <u>underlines</u> and <del>strikethroughs</del>. They're not supported by the base Markdown implementation, but beginnrs will be confused if those buttons don't exist.

[markdown.chibi.io](http://chibicode.github.io/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet) is built with Jekyll and the repo is at: [chibicode/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet](https://github.com/chibicode/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet). Enjoy!
