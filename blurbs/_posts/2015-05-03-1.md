Several of my female friends in Japan have told me that one day, they'd like to become a role model for career-oriented women in Japan. I admire them, considering the grim picture of gender inequality in Japan:

> Japan has one of the worst levels of gender equality in the developed world, below that of Tajikistan and Indonesia, coming in 104th out of 142 assessed countries in 2014, according to a study released Tuesday by the World Economic Forum. (source: [The Japan Times](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/29/national/japan-remains-near-bottom-of-gender-gap-ranking/))

However, I often feel that some of them are doing it wrong. I'd hate to say this, but instead of trying to become *role models*, some are becoming *idols*. Idols are often role models, but I argue that there needs to be a distinction between the two. Here's how I see it:

*Idols* say: **Look at me!**

*Role Models* say: **Look at my work!**

Both types can be recognized as "a role model for X" in the short term. But in the long term, I believe that people will look up to the *look-at-my-work* type much more so than to the *look-at-me* type. Why? Well ask yourself: *who do you look up to?*

Of course, this applies to men, and to people in other countries.
