Heroku began to support [sharing add-ons across different apps](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/1/23/expanding_the_power_of_add_ons) earlier this year.

One use case is to create a separate app that shares the same database as the main one. For me, it allows me to create a simple read-only REST API server alongside a Rails app on a PostgreSQL DB.

To create an API server, I decided to use [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/), a Node.js REST API framework built on top of and by the makers of [Express](http://expressjs.com/). I made a decision based on the article from a year ago called "[Comparing Express, Restify, hapi and LoopBack for building RESTful APIs](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/compare-express-restify-hapi-loopback/)."

Here are some non-trivial things I've encountered. This post will continually be updated.

### Table Names

By default, LoopBack does not seem to use plural table names. So if you created a `Post` model, then the table name will be `post`. This will cause an error like "relation `public.post` does not exist."

To fix, go to the model JSON file (`common/models/*.json`) and add the following under `options`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chibicode/81057881be24c6bef511.js?file=post.json"></script>

[Here's the documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Model+definition+JSON+file#ModeldefinitionJSONfile-Options).

### Environment Specific Configuration

Pretty much all Rails/Heroku developers are using different PostgreSQL servers for development and production. To use different database configurations depending on the environment, [take a look at this documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Environment-specific+configuration).

Here's what I set for my local Postgres server:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chibicode/81057881be24c6bef511.js?file=datasources.json"></script>

and the corresponding `database.yml` in Rails:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chibicode/81057881be24c6bef511.js?file=database.yml"></script>
