I often get asked for career advice from someone who (1) is young and (2) has a full-time commitment (school, job, etc) but isn't 100% happy about it. My default advice for him/her is to *start blogging*.

The biggest benefit of blogging in this case is that it helps you *find a mentor/advisor outside of your current organization*. Your blog won't automatically catch an eye of your future mentor per se, but if you ever run into someone who could be your mentor, you can introduce yourself *along with your blog*. And that often makes a big difference. Ask yourself: if you were to mentor someone who's more junior and there are two candidates - one with a solid blog and one without, all else being equal, which one would you mentor? Of course, having a great professional experience/portfolio would be better, but a solid blog can cover the lack of it.

The second biggest benefit is that writing *generates* ideas. When you're stuck on your career, you need to take actions, but you also need ideas about which actions to take. And you'll miss out on those ideas if you don't write. As Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, [puts it](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html):

> I think it's far more important to write well than most people realize. Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated. ... Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.

But I understand that starting a blog can be challenging. So here's my three pieces of advice for the first time bloggers, all of which I believe are somewhat contrarian. Note that they probably won't be as relevant for people who have written even one blog post in the past.

## 1. Pick an Ugly but Legible Blog Theme

Although I mentioned that your blog is supposed to reflect your values, you don't need to make it *look* like a fancy suit, a gorgeous dress, or even a casual outfit from [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/).

Instead, I recommend you to visually style your blog like *pajamas*. Here's the rule of thumb: (1) stick with the default theme for the blog service you use, or (2) choose a theme that's *uglier* than the default theme - but it should still be legible.

For example, if you're blogging on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), stick to its default theme (currently [Optica](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/37310)), or choose a theme like [Block](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/3):

This one's certainly not as pretty as the default theme, but it's still legible. And Tumblr has a different theme when viewed on mobile, so no need to worry there. Just a side note: this theme is the third oldest theme on Tumblr, designed by Tumblr's founder, [David Karp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Karp).

**Why choose an ugly theme?** Several reasons. First, you'll *minimize* the time to publishing your first article by following this strategy. Ever been late to an important occasion because you couldn't decide on what to wear? Exactly. And even if you think you choose the right theme that

Second and more importantly, you'll try less to look good.
