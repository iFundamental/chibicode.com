This Tweet inspired me to post the job ads I wrote at [EdSurge](http://edsurge.com).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The real guide to interpreting developer job ads. ~via <a href="https://twitter.com/jasongorman">@jasongorman</a> and followers <a href="https://t.co/RNOibyjdYG">pic.twitter.com/RNOibyjdYG</a></p>&mdash; David Whittaker (@rundavidrun) <a href="https://twitter.com/rundavidrun/status/689165491760316416">January 18, 2016</a></blockquote>
