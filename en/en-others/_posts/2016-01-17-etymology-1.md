1/ Some notes from Shoichi Yamanami’s English etymology book: [http://amzn.to/1RNGTGw](http://amzn.to/1RNGTGw)

2/ *kap* (= grab stuff) is the origin of **keep** and **have** (kap≈*hap*). Has latin form *cap* (capture). Also *cap* ≈ *cip* (**anticipate**) and *cup* (**occupy**).

3/ Also, *cap* ≈ *ceive*, *cept*, *ceit* (**receive**, **accept**, **receipt**). *Ex*+*cap*=**escape**. **Capital**=captured livestock. *cap* also means “head” (**captain**).

4/ Origin of “get” → *ghend*, which came from **hand**, so get = “grab w/ hand.” Also: *ghend* became *prehendo*, origin of **apprehend** (arrest).

5/ Latin *deg* (touch and pick something up) became *tag* (**contagious**, **integral**), *tak* (**take**), *tach* (**contact**, **touch**).

6/ Pay attention to edit distance in pronunciation. *ped* means "foot". p/f and d/t are similar sounds, so *ped* → fet → feet → **foot** (e ↔ o).

7/ *ped* (= foot): **pedestrian**, **impede** (obstruct). More consonant/vowel changes: *ped* ≈ *pod*: **tripod**, **podium**. *ped* ≈ *pet* ≈ *pat* ≈ *pas*: **pass**, **pace**.

8/ More inflections (changing the end of a word): *t* becomes *ch*, such as **capture** → **catch**, **port** → **porch** (entrance), **feet** → **fetch**.
