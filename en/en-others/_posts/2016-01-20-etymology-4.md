1/ *ten* means tightened/stretched/correctly tuned/holding on. **tenor** (strong voice), **tenacity/tenure** (holding on), **tone/tune**.

2/ *ten* ≈ *tain* (holding on): **contain** (→ **content**), **obtain**, **abstain** (*abs* = away, so "let go"), **detain** (*de* = down, so "keep from", **detention**)

3/ (cont) **pertain** (*per* = thru, so "always held" → "belong"), **entertain**: keep the vibe among (*enter*) people, **sustain** (*sus* = from below).

4/ *ten* ≈ *tin*: **continue**. *tend* (stretched): **tendency** (pulled in one direction), **tender** (easy to cut, gentle/weak/kind, v: offer help).

5/ *at* (towards) +*tend* (offer) = **attend/attention**. *pre* (before) + *tend* (feel tension) = **pretend**. *ex* (to outside) + *tend* (stretch) = **extend**.

6/ *in* (mind) +*tend* (tighten) = **intend** (fix the mind to). *in* also means "stronger": **intense**.
