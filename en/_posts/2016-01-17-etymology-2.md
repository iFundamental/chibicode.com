1/ *ling* means **linen**. n/g can swap, so *ling* ≈ *lign*: **align**, **line** (a linen string forms a line). More swaps: *per*↔*pre*, *por*↔*pro*, *wer*↔*wre*.

2/ *ling* ≈ *lang* ≈ *long* (b/c a string is long), origin for **tongue** (t/l swap) and **language** (b/c you speak a language w/ a long tongue).

3/ Another reason *ling* derived **language** is the word **linguistics**. Also, *long* ≈ *leng* (**length**). *A*+*long*=**along**, and *be*+*long*=**belong**.

4/ *lig* means "bind (w/ a string)." *ob* (towards) + *lig* = **oblige**/**obligation**. Also root of **religion** (*re* = repeatedly, bind your heart to god).

5/ *lig* ≈ *li* ≈ *ly*, meaning went from “bind” to “responsible”: **liable**, **rely**, **ally**, **liaison** (= close relationship).

6/ *co* (together) + *ally* = **coalition** (political allies). Also, *lig* ≈ *log* ≈ *loy*, so **alloy** (bind metals), **loyal** ≈ **legal**.  *lig* also dervied **league**.
