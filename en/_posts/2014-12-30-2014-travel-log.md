### September 2014

- **Berlin, Germany** — Loved it. Full of young creatives and cheap everything. Attended [CSSConf EU](http://2014.cssconf.eu/). ([Photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chibicode/sets/72157647587142756/))

### October 2014

- **Portland, OR** — My new favorite city in the US. People were really nice. THe only thing people seem to complain are the weather and lack of diversity. ([Photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chibicode/sets/72157648183025019/))

### November 2014

- **Chicago, IL** — First time ever in Chicago. It's a huge, hipster, yet humble city in the Midwest. Chicago suburbs looked a lot like Pittsburgh's (I was there for college). Cold as hell though.

### December 2014

- **Vancouver, BC** — My second time in Vancouver. Downtown is really pretty during the Christmas season.
- **Whistler, BC** — Tagged along with my girlfriend, who was attending [SmashingConf](http://smashingconf.com/whistler-2014/). Tried to snowboard but there was no snow.
- **Tokyo, Japan** — Roppongi had gorgeous illuminations. ([Photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chibicode/sets/72157647660753243/))
- **Wakayama, Japan** — Saw my grandparents.
- **Osaka, Japan** — Saw my grandparents and relatives.

## Plans for 2015?

I don't plan on traveling much in 2015, but I'd love to visit:

- **New Orleans, LA** - Never been. Hoping to attend [NOLA Jazz Fest](http://www.nojazzfest.com/) in May.
- **Victoria, BC** - Never been. Planning for a visit in Spring or Summer 2015.
