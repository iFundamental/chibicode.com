This post is an ongoing collection of SF Bay Area hiking courses I've tried. I was too lazy to write long reviews on Yelp.

## East Bay

* **[Mission Peak Regional Preserve](http://www.bahiker.com/eastbayhikes/missionpeak.html)** — 5.6 miles, moderately tough

    ★★★★☆ — First went in Sprig 2013. Better with friends. Easy parking at Ohlone College. Portable Toilet at Parking.

## Mid-Peninsula

* **[San Bruno Mountain State and County Park](http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/sanbrunosummit.html)** — 3.5 miles, easy

    ★★☆☆☆ — First went in Winter 2014. Very close to SFO. Great view of Daly City. Easy parking. Didn't find a toilet.

* **[Edgewood Park and Reserve](http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/edgewood.html)** — 4.2 miles, easy

    ★★★☆☆ — First went in Spring 2014. Limited parking but clean restooms. A refreshing hike.

* **[Rancho San Antonio County Park](http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/rancho.html)** — 5.5 miles, easy

    ★★☆☆☆ — First went in Winter 2014. Had to quit in the middle b/c I went late. Lots of parking but they're always full. Clean restooms.

* **[Windy Hill Open Space Preserve](http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/whsrhg.html)** — 7.2 miles, moderately tough
