[EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/) is looking for a Rails engineer with a solid understanding of JavaScript. EdSurge currently offers six products: [News](https://www.edsurge.com/news), [Events](https://www.edsurge.com/summits/overview), [Product Reviews](https://www.edsurge.com/products/), [Research](https://www.edsurge.com/reports), [Jobs](https://www.edsurge.com/jobs), and most recently, [Concierge](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-06-23-a-personal-concierge-for-edtech-companies-and-school-leaders). We're expanding our engineering team (currently at 4 devs) to take each of our product to a new level.

Here are the set of the questions we'll use to judge a candidate for this position:

### Can you be productive in our codebase from day 1?

We have 2 Rails apps in production - one for Concierge ([concierge.edsurge.com](http://concierge.edsurge.com/)), and the another for everything else we do (we call it the "main" app). To give you a sense of the scale of each codebase, here are some stats.

Our "main" Rails app is a standard Rails app, tested with RSpec and hosted on Heroku. We use jQuery for the frontend.

- `find app -name '*.rb' | wc -l` returns 533
- `find app -name '*.rb' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 24439
- `find spec -name '*.rb' | wc -l` returns 352
- `find spec -name '*.rb' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 16843
- `find app -name '*.coffee' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 3060
- `find app -name '*.scss' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 7176
- [Gemfile looks like this](https://gist.github.com/chibicode/0956f119ef7acbaa48d3)

For our concierge Rails app, we use Rails as an API server and [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) for the frontend, written in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

- `find app -name '*.rb' | wc -l` returns 142
- `find app -name '*.rb' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 4467
- `find frontend/src -name '*.js' | wc -l` returns 139
- `find frontend/src -name '*.js' | xargs cat | wc -l` returns 4489
- [Gemfile looks like this](https://gist.github.com/chibicode/6f23609068417330ffcf)
- [package.json looks like this](https://gist.github.com/chibicode/4dd04e21af94816a0fb3)

We don't expect you to be familiar with React/Redux/ES6, but you do need a solid understanding of JavaScript and some other front-end frameworks (e.g. AngularJS) to become productive quickly.

If these descriptions of our codebase seem overwhelming to you, you might want to look elsewhere. Of course, we'll help you onboard with our codebase, but don't expect that we'll be handholding you through our codebase after day 30.

### In 30-60 days, can you develop an instinct on how to avoid bad technical decisions (specific to our product/codebase)?

At EdSurge, we have different teams for each of our products, and each team usually has one engineer. But for new engineers, we pair them with an experienced engineer until they're ready to handle things on their own. For this position, we're looking for someone who can make this transition (from pairing to becoming independent) within 30-60 days.

In order to do so, you'll need to develop an instinct on how to avoid bad technical decisions (specific to our product/codebase) such that we can ship great products to users reliably. Put another way, let's say we're building a new feature X, and you'll have to make decisions on database architecture, external libraries, how to connect service objects together, etc, in order to minimize development time and technical debt.

For most junior developers, the 30-60 day timeline to make this transition should be very challenging. But for intermediate developers, this should be moderately easy.

### Are you passionate about EdTech from day 1?

One of the most common reasons we reject a candidate (not just for enginering) at EdSurge is that he/she doesn't seem all that interested in education technology. It's a great field to be in, but also a tough field to succeed. So we'd like to see a decent amount of interest in edtech for our engineering candidates.

If you read [our website](https://www.edsurge.com/) or newsletter (which you can [view from here](https://www.edsurge.com/signup)), then great! If you haven't, but if you find [what we write](https://www.edsurge.com/) very interesting, that's great too. It'd help if you could explain to us why you're passionate about edtech (on your cover letter, etc).

### In 30-60 days, can you develop an instinct on how to avoid miscommunications with our non-technical team members?

As I mentioned before, at EdSurge, we have different teams for each of our products, and you'll most likely be working with our non-technical team members (plus a product manager and a designer). In such teams, the biggest challenge an engineer faces is miscommunications.

Ideally, we'd like to hire someone who can learn how our team works to minimize the chance of miscommunications from happening, and learn it quickly - within 30-60 days of starting. Again, for junior developers who have never worked with non-technical teammates, this would likely take more than 60 days, but shouldn't be too challenging for intermediate developers who are good communicators.

If you can say "yes" to all of the above answers (and prove that during our interview process), we'd like to hire you. Email me (Shu Uesugi) at [shu@edsurge.com](mailto:shu@edsurge.com). And before you send me an email, I'd appreciate it if you could read [this article](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3904-youre-a-product-and-your-job-application-is-a-user-interface) from Basecamp's blog - it has lots of good advice on how to make yourself stand out.
